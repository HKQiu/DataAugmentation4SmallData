# DAGNN for PIs
This is the 2nd part of project PPP-Prediction Properties of Polymers from Sun's AI4P Workshop.
**All data and code** about model training and polyScreen software are in this repository.
The data used to train the models mentioned in this work can be found at /model, and the weights of the optimal model can also be found. 
In addition, the related code and the toolkit – **polyScreen2** are also open source at /polyScreen2.
